# Generative-Models-for-Visual-Signals

## Description

This is the HW4 of the class FUNDAMENTALS AND APPLICATIONS OF GENERATIVE AI (Deadline - 2024/06/18).  
The task is to implement Technical Integration of DDPM and DIP.  

DIP_with_DDPM.ipynb: DIP model with DDPM training method  
Traditional_DIP.ipynb: Traditional DIP model  
5LayersDIP_with_DDPM.ipynb: DIP model with 5 layers with DDPM  
Traditional_5LayersDIP.ipynb: Traditional DIP model with 5 layers  
Different_Denoising_Schedule.ipynb: DIP with DDPM and different denoising schedule  
LR-too-high.ipynb: failed because of too high learning rate  

The code is written in Python 3 and run on Google Colab with T4 GPU.  
Code comments are written to help understanding the logic.
